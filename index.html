                          The goal of our project is to see the correlation between crimes and incarceration, and also how much crime and incarceration occurs. We built this website for people to be able to see how safe their city is based on those two factors, but also for people to see whether mass incarceration improves safety or worsens it.

                      Decision Tree Learning is a <b>supervised learning approach used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning, as it splits the data into partitions or branches, and then continue splitting each partition into smaller groups as the method moves up each branch</b>. Just like the Random forest Regression, the decision tree can also be used for both regression and classification problems. What set the difference is that the random forest algorithm provides a higher level of accuracy in predicting outcomes than the decision tree algorithm, which reduces the overfitting problems in decision trees and also reduces the variance and therefore improves the accuracy. The Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision tree makes decisions by splitting nodes into sub-nodes. This process is performed multiple times during the training process until only homogenous nodes are left. And it is the only reason why a decision tree can perform so well. Therefore, node splitting is a key concept that everyone should know. A significant advantage of a decision tree is that it forces the consideration of all possible outcomes of a decision and traces each path to a conclusion. It creates a comprehensive analysis of the consequences along each branch and identifies decision nodes that need further analysis. It allows an individual or organization to weigh possible actions against one another based on their costs, probabilities, and benefits.

                       </b>the evaluation is vital to compare the performance of each and every model. There is a wide selection of metrics to choose from but only a small fraction suits for regression problems such as ours. We used 3 different metrics to rate the model predictions upon how close they are to the real values.</p>
                        <p class="lead">1. Mean Squared Error</p>
                      <ul>
                        We will use the Linear Regression model to understand how our metric works. The model gave us a line (Blue) as output which predicts the results (Green Squares). Because it is very unlikely that the ideal line is found which matches the values perfectly, we have to calculate the deviation by measuring the vertical distance between our real value and the line.<br>
                        <img class = "other" src = "lreg.png" />
                      </ul>
                      
                      <ul>
                        MSE is calculated by the sum of square of prediction error which is real output minus predicted output and then divide by the number of data points. It gives you an absolute number on how much your predicted results deviate from the actual number.<br>
                
                   <img class = "other" src = "mse.png" />

                        <p class="lead">2. Mean Absolute Error</p>
                  <ul>
                    Mean Absolute Error(MAE) is similar to Mean Square Error(MSE). However, instead of the sum of square of error in MSE, MAE is taking the sum of the absolute value of error.
                     MSE gives larger penalization to big prediction error by square it while MAE treats all errors the same.<br>
                    <img class = "other" src = "mae.png" />
                  </ul>
                      
                        <p class="lead">3. R² / Adjusted R²</p>
                      <ul>
                        R Square is calculated by the sum of squared of prediction error divided by the total sum of the square which replaces the calculated prediction with mean. R Square value is between 0 to 1 and a bigger value indicates a better fit between prediction and actual value. Imagine you draw a horizontal line through all the values such that the total deviation is minimized. Now we compare that sum to the sum of the total distance to our calculated line and subtract the quotient of these two values from 1. If our line predicts the values far better than the horizontal line the subtractive should be small and our R² value close to 1.

                        <p class="lead">
After completing the data analysis and model evaluation, our team came to the conclusion that the Random Forest model would work best for our dataset. Random Forest gave more accurate results after performing GridSearchCV in comparison to the linear Regression and decision tree models. Compared to the decision tree model, random forest models are a stronger modeling technique and much more robust than a single decision tree, as they can aggregate many decision trees to limit overfitting as well as errors due to bias and therefore yield useful results.
